<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 52px;" > 4 Bit MicroController  🀆 </h1>

 Welcome to our `4 Bit` microcontroller project! 👋
 
Our microcontroller is capable of performing a range of instructions including loading and storing data, jumping to specific addresses, arithmetic operations, and conditional jumps based on user-defined conditions. 

This `README` file will provide an overview of the various instructions and capabilities of our microcontroller


# 🚀 Features:

Following are the instructions our microcontroller is capable to perform:

- `LOAD` VALUE TO REGISTER  
- `STORE` DATA FROM REGISTER TO `RAM`
- `LOAD` DATA FROM RAM TO `REGISTER`
- `JUMP` TO SPECIFIED ADDRESS OF PROGRAM
- `ADDING` TWO REGISTER
- `SUBTRACTING` TWO REGISTER
- `INCREMENT` REGISTER
- `MOVE` VALUE FROM REGISTER TO `REGISTER`
- `JUMP` TO FOLLOWING `ADDRESS` TO PROGRAM IF ONE OF THE CONDITION IS MET DEPENDING ON USER

> IF CARRY FLAG IS ZERO OR ONE


>  IF ZERO FLAG IS ONE OR ZERO
